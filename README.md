### Hi there! 🙋🏽‍♀️
- I'm Fabiana Simplício, but you can call me Fabi.
- I'm a Computer Science student at the Federal University of Campina Grande.
- I'm interested in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am learning about front-end development.
- Fun fact: I started my journey in tech in 2024 after switching careers from teaching Portuguese language and literature.
